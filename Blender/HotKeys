General (most window types) ============================================================================================================================================================================================
Toolbar = T
Properties = N
Add Object/Node = Shift + A
Delete = X or Delete
Search = F3
Move/Grab = G
Scale = S
Rotate = R
Rotating on Axis = Best Practice = When rotating in 3D, it get's messy, it might look like you are rotating correctly, but it only takes a few degrees off to make it look horrible, use rotate on axis(X,Y,Z) to keep assets clean
Rotate along axis = R then X/Y/Z
Rotate along local axis = R then X,X/Y,Y/Z,Z
Trackball Rotate = R, R
Precise movement = Shift (hold)
Incremental movement = Ctrl (hold)
Duplicate = Shift + D = Pro Tip: Create Shapes that you are going to be reusing alot for your project off scene, and copy paste them when needed (lumber/rocks/windows/lamps/books/plants-etc)
  When Better at design - create a 'starter file' with a bunch of starter assets you can reuse - pull in whatever assets you need to your new project instead of rebuilding
Duplicate Linked = Alt + D
Hide = H
Unhide All = Alt + H
Hide all Except Selected = Shift + H
Annotate = D (hold) + LMB (drag)
Erase Annotation = D (hold) + RMB (drag)
Quick favs menu = Q
Ctrl + A = Apply Transforms (Should do this every major shape change - if something isn't behaving the way you want it to, you probably forgot to apply transforms) 
  Reset CenterPoint = 'Right Click' Object -> 'Set Origin' -> 'Origin To Geometry' = After applying transforms center point is sometimes off, you can reset it to the object
Array Tool = 'Modifier Tab' -> 'Array' = Duplicates your shape, can tell it how many times you want to duplicate and space inbetween each shape (Trees/Stairs/Pillars/Roof/
Mirror = 'Modifer Tab' -> 'Mirror' = Allows you to mirror an object/array instead of duplicating and placing - change one and change both/all
'Camera To View' = Click on Camera, When Selected click 'Camera to View' checkbox = Instead of manually repositioning camera, checking, repeat ad infitum - Go FPV - and move camera to exactly where it needs to be
'Max Samples' = Rendering Modifer Tab = Quicker Rendering by reducing samples, each 'sample' is a rerender, the more passes, the crisper the image, can take multiple minutes, speed it up by reducing the samples (4096 vs 10 samples)

Loop Cut = 'Edit Mode' + 'Ctrl + R' = Might have to reposition cuts = Works on any shape. Quick, easy way to subdivide any object (long rectangle into x5 squares) which makes it easier to move and manipulate shape faces 
  Scroll up/down = Will increase/decrease amount of subdivisions you are making with Loop Cut
Inset Tool = Have a face selected, Tap 'I' + Move Mouse In/Out for size = If you want to add a window/hole, Inset is the easiest/fastest way 
Extrude Tool = Tap 'E' =  Once you have inset something tap 'E' to extrude it to push it in or pull it out (create Pipes/Windows/ Etc)
