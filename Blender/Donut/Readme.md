End:</br>
I will give my DoNut a girls name, because this is the only hole I am going to get.</br>
1. This is my Donut. There are many like it, but this one is mine.</br>
2. My Donut is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.</br>
3. My Donut, without me, is useless. Without my Donut, I am useless. I must fire my Donut true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me.</br>
4. My Donut and myself know that what counts in Blender is not the Shaders we fire, the vectors of our polygons, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count.</br>
5. My Donut is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel.</br>
  I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my Donut clean and ready. We will become part of each other.</br>
6. Before God, I swear this creed. My Donut and myself are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.</br>
7. So be it, until victory is Americaâ€™s and there is no enemy, but peace!!</br>
