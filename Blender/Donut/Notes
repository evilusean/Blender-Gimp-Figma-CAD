First, need to finish my main ThreeJS Course meal, before dessert. I'm doing the 4th version of the tutorial - released 4 months ago on youtube - so it won't be outdated - 2016 / 2019 / 2021 / 2023
Part 1 = Basic Controls = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&index=1&ab_channel=BlenderGuru ====================================================================================
Open Source(based) 3D software, that can be used to make anything 3D - animations / visualizeASeans / FX / Game Assets / etc
80/20 = only 20% of blenders features you use 80% of the time - lot's of buttons/tools(that's a good thing) - easy to get overwhelmed 
3D Viewport = your main view, how you can interact with the models, where you spend >90% of your time, initially you can see 3 objects, when you click on it, you can see it's selected because it highlights in orange
  Camera / Cube / Lamp(love) 
Step 1) Delete the Default Cube - Replace with a torus - Top Menus -> 'Add' OR 
'SHIFT + A' To get to the add menu -> Mesh -> 
  Mesh Primitives = Euclidean Geometry / Basic Shapes - Monkee
'Middle Mouse Click In + Drag' = Enables Orbit = Allows you to rotate around the 3D viewport 
  If no mouse there is a grey circle with X,Y,Z that you can use to orbit in the top right corner of the 3D Viewport - Left Click+Drag on that to orbit without a mouse 
    Or Preference 'Emulate 3 button mouse' Option = 'Alt + Left Click Drag'
'Middle Mouse Scroll Up/Down' = Scroll In/Out Zoom + 'Ctrl + MiddleMouse Click + Move Up/down' = Smooth Zoom In/Out - Top Right 3D Viewport 'Magnifying Glass' Left Click Drag Left/Right = Zoom In / Out -  
ViewPort Shading = The light gray shading you see on the model is called 'ViewPort Shading', and it's a lightweight optimized way to view the scene as your building it
Rendering = to make it pretty, switch in to rendering mode = Top Right Hand Corner -> 4 little circles -> Click 'Render View Mode'
  you will now have directional lighting, and shadows will be cast 
Pan = The 'Focus' is on the monkee, you can pan to something else in 2 different ways:
  1) 'Shift + Middle Mouse Click + Drag' = Will allow you to move around the screen and change your view
  2) Top Right Hand corner 'Hand' Tool to move around
Move an Object = To move an object(model/light/camera) - you can do it in 2 different ways:
  1) Tap 'G' Hotkey = G for 'Grab' will allow you to move objects - To Cancel press 'Esc' or 'Right Click' - To Confirm = 'Left Click' -
    Controlled Move = After 'Tap G', 'Hold X Key' 'Hold Y Key' 'Hold Z Key' Will allow you to move on corresponding axis - 'Tap G + Press Mid Mouse' will bring up an axis component that will snap to mouse cursor + axis
  2) Left Hand Corner of 3D viewport, floating menu, 'Move Tool' -> Click on 'Gizmo Axis' to move on X,Y,Z Coords, or click on 'Gizmo White Circle' to free move
'Industry Compatible KeyBindings' = 'Preferences' -> 'KeyMap' = Will allow you to change keybindings to another program you are familiar with
'Render' (Take Picture) = The way to take an image in blender is to do a render - It Will Render from the Camera, not where you are orbitted from in the 3D Viewport
  1) 'F12'
  2) Top Menus -> Render -> Render Image -> New Window -> Image -> Save As
'Camera' = To Go to The Camera
  1) 'Num Pad 0'
  2) Top Right Corner -> Camera Icon
'Move Camera' = 'G + Middle Mouse' OR Easier Method Below
  'Move Camera To ViewPort = Go to 'Outliner' -> Select Camera -> Press 'N' -> Select 'View' in right hand side menus -> Click 'Camera to View' Box - Disable by Pressing N again and disabling when in correct camera position
'Outliner' = Top Right Rightside outside of 3D Viewport = Inventory of all objects in your scene
'Properties' = 'N' - From Outliner, Middle Right Section outside of 3D Viewport, where you can mess around with the properties of the objects in the scene, multiple menus, ones for render, color, 
'Scale' = To change the size of an object
  1) 'S' + Mouse = Will scale all size keeping same proportions - 'S + Z Keys' + Mouse = Will Scale on the Z Axis(height) making it taller - 'S + X' 'S + Y' = Fatter 
  2) Top Left Hand Side Menu of Viewport 
'Rotate' = 'R' OR Tool can be found in the Left Hand ViewPort Menu 
  'R + X' Rotates on X Axis - 'R + Y' = Rotates on Y Axis - 'R + Z' = Rotates on Z Axis

Part 2 = Basic Modeling = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBpnKTAc5Eo&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&index=2&ab_channel=BlenderGuru ===================================================================================
'Shit + A' -> Create Torus -> Directly after creating a new object, in the bottom left corner of the 3D viewport there will be a tab - click on it - You will now get to select 'Options' for your newly created object
'F9' = Options = You can alter major parts of your object, you can change size, resolution, 
The higher your resolution, it just means the more polys/faces you will have on your object - it doesn't actually make it higher res - like the numbers on scopes - doesn't make it go faster - range - higher res = harder to render
  It is easier to add resolution than it is to take it away (inverse of photos = You can always go down in res, never up) - try to have as few polys as you can when starting 
Tut - Initial Donut 'Stats' = Major Segments = 32 / Minor Segments = 12 / Major Radius = 0.39m / Minor Rad = 0.25m - Click off and menu is gone 'F9' to bring it back
Smooth Shading = Right Click on empty space in 3D viewport -> Select 'Shade Smooth' = To increase resolution, make object look less jagged, averages out faces, tells renderer it's a high poly when it isn't - won't add to render time
Shade Flat Mode =  Right Click on empty space in 3D viewport -> Select 'Shade Flat' = Opposite of Smooth shading - Will show polygons clearly
Modifiers = Far Left Menu of 'Properties' -> click on the 'Wrench' -> 'Add Modifier' -> Many Options -> 'Generate' -> 'Subdivision Surface'
  Subdivision Surface = 'Ctrl + 1' = Will smooth out the currently selected object - 'Levels Viewport' Option = As you increase this (1level = x4 Face) it will increase the resolution of the object to the mesh, adds more detail/faces
  'Levels Viewport' vs 'Render' Option = You generally want to keep the viewport levels low, and increase them for the render, for speed/performance, the viewport is for practice, the render is the pretty version
Tut - Subdivision Surface Values = Levels Viewport = 1 / Render = 1 / Smooth Shading Enabled
The procedurally generated donut is too good, to look real (respect) - This is a problem, because things that are too perfect just look fake, so we need to spend time making things look misshapen - ImPerfectSeans - Adding VariaSeans
  You can make it look more lumpy by changing the mesh itself
'Object Mode' / 'Edit Mode' / 'Sculpt Mode' / 'Vertex Paint' / 'Weight Paint' / 'Texture Paint' = Top Left hand corner, click to change modes - Options will change based on which object you have selected(Lamp vs Camera Vs Object)
'Edit Mode' = Will add a lattice structure(Vertices) over your object 
  Vertex = Singular
  Edge = 2 Vertices Connected by a line
  Face = 4 connected by lines
  Tap 'G' = Will allow you to move Vertices - 'Left Click' = Confirm Position - Will Change the shape of the Mesh 
  'Tab' =  Switch between 'Object Mode' and 'Edit Mode' - Will remove the lattice visibility(or bring it back)
'Proportional Editing' = Top Middle(Right Hand Corner) of Viewport in the Toolbar, If you want to move multiple Vertices at once, enable this, increasing/decreasing each vertices is tedious AF
  Tap 'G' = Will now move multiple vertices at once, allowing you to shape the model MUCH easier
  'Circle of Influence' = 'Scroll up/down' or 'Pg Up/Pg Down' to increase or decrease, Change the size of the ring to change the AEffected Zone, Will only aeffect what is in the ring
'Edge Select' = Hold 'Alt' + Click on an Edge(Not Vertice-The line part) = It will select all the vertices on that row
  'S' = Scale = To change size
'Save As' = Blender saves files as '.blend' extension - 1 file

Part 3 = Modelling the Icing ============================================================================================================================================================================================================
