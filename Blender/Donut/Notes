First, need to finish my main ThreeJS Course meal, before dessert. I'm doing the 4th version of the tutorial - released 4 months ago on youtube - so it won't be outdated - 2016 / 2019 / 2021 / 2023
Part 1 = Basic Controls = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&index=1&ab_channel=BlenderGuru ====================================================================================
Open Source(based) 3D software, that can be used to make anything 3D - animations / visualizeASeans / FX / Game Assets / etc
80/20 = only 20% of blenders features you use 80% of the time - lot's of buttons/tools(that's a good thing) - easy to get overwhelmed 
3D Viewport = your main view, how you can interact with the models, where you spend >90% of your time, initially you can see 3 objects, when you click on it, you can see it's selected because it highlights in orange
  Camera / Cube / Lamp(love) 
Step 1) Delete the Default Cube - Replace with a torus - Top Menus -> 'Add' OR 
'SHIFT + A' To get to the add menu -> Mesh -> 
  Mesh Primitives = Euclidean Geometry / Basic Shapes - Monkee
'Middle Mouse Click In + Drag' = Enables Orbit = Allows you to rotate around the 3D viewport 
  If no mouse there is a grey circle with X,Y,Z that you can use to orbit in the top right corner of the 3D Viewport - Left Click+Drag on that to orbit without a mouse 
    Or Preference 'Emulate 3 button mouse' Option = 'Alt + Left Click Drag'
'Middle Mouse Scroll Up/Down' = Scroll In/Out Zoom + 'Ctrl + MiddleMouse Click + Move Up/down' = Smooth Zoom In/Out - Top Right 3D Viewport 'Magnifying Glass' Left Click Drag Left/Right = Zoom In / Out -  
ViewPort Shading = The light gray shading you see on the model is called 'ViewPort Shading', and it's a lightweight optimized way to view the scene as your building it
Rendering = to make it pretty, switch in to rendering mode = Top Right Hand Corner -> 4 little circles -> Click 'Render View Mode'
  you will now have directional lighting, and shadows will be cast 
Pan = The 'Focus' is on the monkee, you can pan to something else in 2 different ways:
  1) 'Shift + Middle Mouse Click + Drag' = Will allow you to move around the screen and change your view
  2) Top Right Hand corner 'Hand' Tool to move around
Move an Object = To move an object(model/light/camera) - you can do it in 2 different ways:
  1) Tap 'G' Hotkey = G for 'Grab' will allow you to move objects - To Cancel press 'Esc' or 'Right Click' - To Confirm = 'Left Click' -
    Controlled Move = After 'Tap G', 'Hold X Key' 'Hold Y Key' 'Hold Z Key' Will allow you to move on corresponding axis - 'Tap G + Press Mid Mouse' will bring up an axis component that will snap to mouse cursor + axis
  2) Left Hand Corner of 3D viewport, floating menu, 'Move Tool' -> Click on 'Gizmo Axis' to move on X,Y,Z Coords, or click on 'Gizmo White Circle' to free move
'Industry Compatible KeyBindings' = 'Preferences' -> 'KeyMap' = Will allow you to change keybindings to another program you are familiar with
'Render' (Take Picture) = The way to take an image in blender is to do a render - It Will Render from the Camera, not where you are orbitted from in the 3D Viewport
  1) 'F12'
  2) Top Menus -> Render -> Render Image -> New Window -> Image -> Save As
'Camera' = To Go to The Camera
  1) 'Num Pad 0'
  2) Top Right Corner -> Camera Icon
'Move Camera' = 'G + Middle Mouse' OR Easier Method Below
  'Move Camera To ViewPort = Go to 'Outliner' -> Select Camera -> Press 'N' -> Select 'View' in right hand side menus -> Click 'Camera to View' Box - Disable by Pressing N again and disabling when in correct camera position
'Outliner' = Top Right Rightside outside of 3D Viewport = Inventory of all objects in your scene
'Properties' = 'N' - From Outliner, Middle Right Section outside of 3D Viewport, where you can mess around with the properties of the objects in the scene, multiple menus, ones for render, color, 
'Scale' = To change the size of an object
  1) 'S' + Mouse = Will scale all size keeping same proportions - 'S + Z Keys' + Mouse = Will Scale on the Z Axis(height) making it taller - 'S + X' 'S + Y' = Fatter 
  2) Top Left Hand Side Menu of Viewport 
'Rotate' = 'R' OR Tool can be found in the Left Hand ViewPort Menu 
  'R + X' Rotates on X Axis - 'R + Y' = Rotates on Y Axis - 'R + Z' = Rotates on Z Axis

Part 2 = Basic Modeling = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBpnKTAc5Eo&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&index=2&ab_channel=BlenderGuru ===================================================================================
'Shit + A' -> Create Torus -> Directly after creating a new object, in the bottom left corner of the 3D viewport there will be a tab - click on it - You will now get to select 'Options' for your newly created object
'F9' = Options = You can alter major parts of your object, you can change size, resolution, 
The higher your resolution, it just means the more polys/faces you will have on your object - it doesn't actually make it higher res - like the numbers on scopes - doesn't make it go faster - range - higher res = harder to render
  It is easier to add resolution than it is to take it away (inverse of photos = You can always go down in res, never up) - try to have as few polys as you can when starting 
Tut - Initial Donut 'Stats' = Major Segments = 32 / Minor Segments = 12 / Major Radius = 0.39m / Minor Rad = 0.25m - Click off and menu is gone 'F9' to bring it back
Smooth Shading = Right Click on empty space in 3D viewport -> Select 'Shade Smooth' = To increase resolution, make object look less jagged, averages out faces, tells renderer it's a high poly when it isn't - won't add to render time
Shade Flat Mode =  Right Click on empty space in 3D viewport -> Select 'Shade Flat' = Opposite of Smooth shading - Will show polygons clearly
Modifiers = Far Left Menu of 'Properties' -> click on the 'Wrench' -> 'Add Modifier' -> Many Options -> 'Generate' -> 'Subdivision Surface'
  Subdivision Surface = 'Ctrl + 1' = Will smooth out the currently selected object - 'Levels Viewport' Option = As you increase this (1level = x4 Face) it will increase the resolution of the object to the mesh, adds more detail/faces
  'Levels Viewport' vs 'Render' Option = You generally want to keep the viewport levels low, and increase them for the render, for speed/performance, the viewport is for practice, the render is the pretty version
Tut - Subdivision Surface Values = Levels Viewport = 1 / Render = 1 / Smooth Shading Enabled
The procedurally generated donut is too good, to look real (respect) - This is a problem, because things that are too perfect just look fake, so we need to spend time making things look misshapen - ImPerfectSeans - Adding VariaSeans
  You can make it look more lumpy by changing the mesh itself
'Object Mode' / 'Edit Mode' / 'Sculpt Mode' / 'Vertex Paint' / 'Weight Paint' / 'Texture Paint' = Top Left hand corner, click to change modes - Options will change based on which object you have selected(Lamp vs Camera Vs Object)
'Edit Mode' = Will add a lattice structure(Vertices) over your object 
  Vertex = Singular
  Edge = 2 Vertices Connected by a line
  Face = 4 connected by lines
  Tap 'G' = Will allow you to move Vertices - 'Left Click' = Confirm Position - Will Change the shape of the Mesh 
  'Tab' =  Switch between 'Object Mode' and 'Edit Mode' - Will remove the lattice visibility(or bring it back)
'Proportional Editing' = Top Middle(Right Hand Corner) of Viewport in the Toolbar, If you want to move multiple Vertices at once, enable this, increasing/decreasing each vertices is tedious AF
  Tap 'G' = Will now move multiple vertices at once, allowing you to shape the model MUCH easier
  'Circle of Influence' = 'Scroll up/down' or 'Pg Up/Pg Down' to increase or decrease, Change the size of the ring to change the AEffected Zone, Will only aeffect what is in the ring
'Edge Select' = Hold 'Alt' + Click on an Edge(Not Vertice-The line part) = It will select all the vertices on that row
  'S' = Scale = To change size
'Save As' = Blender saves files as '.blend' extension - 1 file

Part 3 = Modelling the Icing ============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Blender 4.0 had a change that makes it more realistic by default, new rendering tech - genie, luma labs = 3D text to image
'Shift + A' = Add an object
'Shift + D' = Duplicate Object, Or top dropdown menu 'object' -> duplicate objects / 'Esc' OR 'Right Click' = Cancel / 
  'F2' + Selected Object = 'rename' Don't(do nut-heh) forget to name your objects after duping, or you can get confused easily - double click object in outliner and rename
'Toggle X Ray' = Top Left of Viewport Menu = Allows you to see through a mesh, and select an entire part of donut (click and drag select vertices will not work through a mesh)
'Solidifier Modifier' = Properties -> Modifiers(wrench) -> Add Modifier -> Generate -> Solidify 
  Tut - Change solidify modifier offset = 1.0 / Thickness = 0.025 
  When you are trying to check the vertices in edit mode, the modifier will block out the vertices, fix that by deselecting 'edit mode boxes' below
'Modifier Boxes' = In the top part of each unique modifier by the name =  When enabled allow you to see it in coressponding mode, when deselected, will allow it to be hidden
'Snap' = Top Middle of Viewport (In the dropdown menu, Make sure to select off increment, to 'face') = In Edit mode, the object vertice you are editing will snap to the nearest face - only the individual vertex, 
  'Face Project' Option in the Snap Dropdown = Will snap all surrounding vertices to the object, and it will no longer clip through the donut
If you get clipping issues, add more geometry, bring more vertexes to go over your object, so it can cover over more parts of the surface of another object, to do this use the 'Subdivision Surface Modifier'
'Subdivision Surface Modifier' Next to modifier Name -> Dropdown arrow -> Click 'Apply' = Will add more geometry to work with 
Tut - Had to Restart From Scratch - Tried to make a 'sad/smiling donut' and it had messed up geometry - saved all the inputs to get back to this stage - 'Ctrl + F' + 'Tut' = How to get back to the tutorial values, saved thankfully
Just finished recreating the icing again, and need 2 finish 2 tuts today(Tuesday) to (2 2 2 2 2's) be up to date(1 per day - minimum) - Will create a new save file with seperate name to act as a gap stop in case I need to restart again
If the circle of influence is too large while changing a vertice it will suck in vertices on the opposite side of the donut, it will reach the vertices on the other side of the donut(try to keep CoI small so this doesn't happen)
  the 'snapping' combined with a large 'circle of influence' will cause the vertices on the back to 'snap' to the vertices on the front - and look extremely fugly, hard to fix if you don't 'Ctrl + Z' immediately
'Alt + Left Click' On A vertice = Selects all vertices on that 'row'
'Ctrl + "+"' = Enables the Select More Tool = Will expand the vertices row by row / 'Ctrl + "-"' = Will decrease the Vertices rows 1 by 1 / Dropdown Menu Top of Viewport 'Select' -> 'Select More/Less'
'H' With Vertices Selected = 'H'ide, will hide the selected vertices / 'Alt + H' = UnHides the hidden vertices / DropDown Menu Top of Vieport 'Mesh' -> 'Show/Hide' -> 'Reveal Hidden' / 'Hide Selected' / 'Hide Unselected'
Big / Medium / Small Details = Recipe for 'Good Design'
'Subdivision Surface' = Modifier Stack -> 'Add Modifier' -> 'Generate' -> 'Subdivision Surface' = To fix 90 degree edges when they shouldn't be there add another 'Subdivision Surface' 
  Tut - Order Does matter - Solidifer at top, Subdivision after it - You want the extrusion to happen first, and THEN round that edge, 
** FOR MODIFIERS ** Blender Works top to bottom, ORDER DOES MATTER **
To make the icing less jagged we can change the 'Edge Data' option in the 'solidifier modifier' = Will tell blender before you do the solidify step, add a crease on the inner part
  Tut - change the 'Edge Data' option in the 'solidifier modifier' = Change the 'Crease Inner' to '1.0'
Next we are adding some 'Drip'(not zoomerspeak - literal) - Instead of stretching out the vertices, you need to give it more information by 'Extruding'
'Extrude' = Select Vertices while holding down 'Shift', After - Hold 'E' and Pull the Selection Downwards(or whatever direction) to Extrude it = It will add a new section/face, like a tail/trail to our icing
