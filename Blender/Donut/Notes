Start: 15June2024
End:
First, need to finish my main ThreeJS Course meal, before dessert. I'm doing the 4th version of the tutorial - released 4 months ago on youtube - so it won't be outdated - 2016 / 2019 / 2021 / 2023
Part 1 = Basic Controls = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&index=1&ab_channel=BlenderGuru ====================================================================================
Open Source(based) 3D software, that can be used to make anything 3D - animations / visualizeASeans / FX / Game Assets / etc
80/20 = only 20% of blenders features you use 80% of the time - lot's of buttons/tools(that's a good thing) - easy to get overwhelmed 
3D Viewport = your main view, how you can interact with the models, where you spend >90% of your time, initially you can see 3 objects, when you click on it, you can see it's selected because it highlights in orange
  Camera / Cube / Lamp(love) 
Step 1) Delete the Default Cube - Replace with a torus - Top Menus -> 'Add' OR 
'SHIFT + A' To get to the add menu -> Mesh -> 
  Mesh Primitives = Euclidean Geometry / Basic Shapes - Monkee
'Middle Mouse Click In + Drag' = Enables Orbit = Allows you to rotate around the 3D viewport 
  If no mouse there is a grey circle with X,Y,Z that you can use to orbit in the top right corner of the 3D Viewport - Left Click+Drag on that to orbit without a mouse 
    Or Preference 'Emulate 3 button mouse' Option = 'Alt + Left Click Drag'
'Middle Mouse Scroll Up/Down' = Scroll In/Out Zoom + 'Ctrl + MiddleMouse Click + Move Up/down' = Smooth Zoom In/Out - Top Right 3D Viewport 'Magnifying Glass' Left Click Drag Left/Right = Zoom In / Out -  
ViewPort Shading = The light gray shading you see on the model is called 'ViewPort Shading', and it's a lightweight optimized way to view the scene as your building it
Rendering = to make it pretty, switch in to rendering mode = Top Right Hand Corner -> 4 little circles -> Click 'Render View Mode'
  you will now have directional lighting, and shadows will be cast 
Pan = The 'Focus' is on the monkee, you can pan to something else in 2 different ways:
  1) 'Shift + Middle Mouse Click + Drag' = Will allow you to move around the screen and change your view
  2) Top Right Hand corner 'Hand' Tool to move around
Move an Object = To move an object(model/light/camera) - you can do it in 2 different ways:
  1) Tap 'G' Hotkey = G for 'Grab' will allow you to move objects - To Cancel press 'Esc' or 'Right Click' - To Confirm = 'Left Click' -
    Controlled Move = After 'Tap G', 'Hold X Key' 'Hold Y Key' 'Hold Z Key' Will allow you to move on corresponding axis - 'Tap G + Press Mid Mouse' will bring up an axis component that will snap to mouse cursor + axis
  2) Left Hand Corner of 3D viewport, floating menu, 'Move Tool' -> Click on 'Gizmo Axis' to move on X,Y,Z Coords, or click on 'Gizmo White Circle' to free move
'Industry Compatible KeyBindings' = 'Preferences' -> 'KeyMap' = Will allow you to change keybindings to another program you are familiar with
'Render' (Take Picture) = The way to take an image in blender is to do a render - It Will Render from the Camera, not where you are orbitted from in the 3D Viewport
  1) 'F12'
  2) Top Menus -> Render -> Render Image -> New Window -> Image -> Save As
'Camera' = To Go to The Camera
  1) 'Num Pad 0'
  2) Top Right Corner -> Camera Icon
'Move Camera' = 'G + Middle Mouse' OR Easier Method Below
  'Move Camera To ViewPort = Go to 'Outliner' -> Select Camera -> Press 'N' -> Select 'View' in right hand side menus -> Click 'Camera to View' Box - Disable by Pressing N again and disabling when in correct camera position
'Outliner' = Top Right Rightside outside of 3D Viewport = Inventory of all objects in your scene
'Properties' = 'N' - From Outliner, Middle Right Section outside of 3D Viewport, where you can mess around with the properties of the objects in the scene, multiple menus, ones for render, color, 
'Scale' = To change the size of an object
  1) 'S' + Mouse = Will scale all size keeping same proportions - 'S + Z Keys' + Mouse = Will Scale on the Z Axis(height) making it taller - 'S + X' 'S + Y' = Fatter 
  2) Top Left Hand Side Menu of Viewport 
'Rotate' = 'R' OR Tool can be found in the Left Hand ViewPort Menu 
  'R + X' Rotates on X Axis - 'R + Y' = Rotates on Y Axis - 'R + Z' = Rotates on Z Axis

Part 2 = Basic Modeling = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBpnKTAc5Eo&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z&index=2&ab_channel=BlenderGuru ===================================================================================
'Shit + A' -> Create Torus -> Directly after creating a new object, in the bottom left corner of the 3D viewport there will be a tab - click on it - You will now get to select 'Options' for your newly created object
'F9' = Options = You can alter major parts of your object, you can change size, resolution, 
The higher your resolution, it just means the more polys/faces you will have on your object - it doesn't actually make it higher res - like the numbers on scopes - doesn't make it go faster - range - higher res = harder to render
  It is easier to add resolution than it is to take it away (inverse of photos = You can always go down in res, never up) - try to have as few polys as you can when starting 
Tut - Initial Donut 'Stats' = Major Segments = 32 / Minor Segments = 12 / Major Radius = 0.39m / Minor Rad = 0.25m - Click off and menu is gone 'F9' to bring it back
Smooth Shading = Right Click on empty space in 3D viewport -> Select 'Shade Smooth' = To increase resolution, make object look less jagged, averages out faces, tells renderer it's a high poly when it isn't - won't add to render time
Shade Flat Mode =  Right Click on empty space in 3D viewport -> Select 'Shade Flat' = Opposite of Smooth shading - Will show polygons clearly
Modifiers = Far Left Menu of 'Properties' -> click on the 'Wrench' -> 'Add Modifier' -> Many Options -> 'Generate' -> 'Subdivision Surface'
  Subdivision Surface = 'Ctrl + 1' = Will smooth out the currently selected object - 'Levels Viewport' Option = As you increase this (1level = x4 Face) it will increase the resolution of the object to the mesh, adds more detail/faces
  'Levels Viewport' vs 'Render' Option = You generally want to keep the viewport levels low, and increase them for the render, for speed/performance, the viewport is for practice, the render is the pretty version
Tut - Subdivision Surface Values = Levels Viewport = 1 / Render = 1 / Smooth Shading Enabled
The procedurally generated donut is too good, to look real (respect) - This is a problem, because things that are too perfect just look fake, so we need to spend time making things look misshapen - ImPerfectSeans - Adding VariaSeans
  You can make it look more lumpy by changing the mesh itself
'Object Mode' / 'Edit Mode' / 'Sculpt Mode' / 'Vertex Paint' / 'Weight Paint' / 'Texture Paint' = Top Left hand corner, click to change modes - Options will change based on which object you have selected(Lamp vs Camera Vs Object)
'Edit Mode' = Will add a lattice structure(Vertices) over your object 
  Vertex = Singular
  Edge = 2 Vertices Connected by a line
  Face = 4 connected by lines
  Tap 'G' = Will allow you to move Vertices - 'Left Click' = Confirm Position - Will Change the shape of the Mesh 
  'Tab' =  Switch between 'Object Mode' and 'Edit Mode' - Will remove the lattice visibility(or bring it back)
'Proportional Editing' = Top Middle(Right Hand Corner) of Viewport in the Toolbar, If you want to move multiple Vertices at once, enable this, increasing/decreasing each vertices is tedious AF
  Tap 'G' = Will now move multiple vertices at once, allowing you to shape the model MUCH easier
  'Circle of Influence' = 'Scroll up/down' or 'Pg Up/Pg Down' to increase or decrease, Change the size of the ring to change the AEffected Zone, Will only aeffect what is in the ring
'Edge Select' = Hold 'Alt' + Click on an Edge(Not Vertice-The line part) = It will select all the vertices on that row
  'S' = Scale = To change size
'Save As' = Blender saves files as '.blend' extension - 1 file

Part 3 = Modelling the Icing ============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Blender 4.0 had a change that makes it more realistic by default, new rendering tech - genie, luma labs = 3D text to image
'Shift + A' = Add an object
'Shift + D' = Duplicate Object, Or top dropdown menu 'object' -> duplicate objects / 'Esc' OR 'Right Click' = Cancel / 
  'F2' + Selected Object = 'rename' Don't(do nut-heh) forget to name your objects after duping, or you can get confused easily - double click object in outliner and rename
'Toggle X Ray' = Top Left of Viewport Menu = Allows you to see through a mesh, and select an entire part of donut (click and drag select vertices will not work through a mesh)
'Solidifier Modifier' = Properties -> Modifiers(wrench) -> Add Modifier -> Generate -> Solidify 
  Tut - Change solidify modifier offset = 1.0 / Thickness = 0.025 
  When you are trying to check the vertices in edit mode, the modifier will block out the vertices, fix that by deselecting 'edit mode boxes' below
'Modifier Boxes' = In the top part of each unique modifier by the name =  When enabled allow you to see it in coressponding mode, when deselected, will allow it to be hidden
'Snap' = Top Middle of Viewport (In the dropdown menu, Make sure to select off increment, to 'face') = In Edit mode, the object vertice you are editing will snap to the nearest face - only the individual vertex, 
  'Face Project' Option in the Snap Dropdown = Will snap all surrounding vertices to the object, and it will no longer clip through the donut
If you get clipping issues, add more geometry, bring more vertexes to go over your object, so it can cover over more parts of the surface of another object, to do this use the 'Subdivision Surface Modifier'
'Subdivision Surface Modifier' Next to modifier Name -> Dropdown arrow -> Click 'Apply' = Will add more geometry to work with 
Tut - Had to Restart From Scratch - Tried to make a 'sad/smiling donut' and it had messed up geometry - saved all the inputs to get back to this stage - 'Ctrl + F' + 'Tut' = How to get back to the tutorial values, saved thankfully
Just finished recreating the icing again, and need 2 finish 2 tuts today(Tuesday) to (2 2 2 2 2's) be up to date(1 per day - minimum) - Will create a new save file with seperate name to act as a gap stop in case I need to restart again
If the circle of influence is too large while changing a vertice it will suck in vertices on the opposite side of the donut, it will reach the vertices on the other side of the donut(try to keep CoI small so this doesn't happen)
  the 'snapping' combined with a large 'circle of influence' will cause the vertices on the back to 'snap' to the vertices on the front - and look extremely fugly, hard to fix if you don't 'Ctrl + Z' immediately
'Alt + Left Click' On A vertice = Selects all vertices on that 'row'
'Ctrl + "+"' = Enables the Select More Tool = Will expand the vertices row by row / 'Ctrl + "-"' = Will decrease the Vertices rows 1 by 1 / Dropdown Menu Top of Viewport 'Select' -> 'Select More/Less'
'H' With Vertices Selected = 'H'ide, will hide the selected vertices / 'Alt + H' = UnHides the hidden vertices / DropDown Menu Top of Vieport 'Mesh' -> 'Show/Hide' -> 'Reveal Hidden' / 'Hide Selected' / 'Hide Unselected'
Big / Medium / Small Details = Recipe for 'Good Design'
'Subdivision Surface' = Modifier Stack -> 'Add Modifier' -> 'Generate' -> 'Subdivision Surface' = To fix 90 degree edges when they shouldn't be there add another 'Subdivision Surface' 
  Tut - Order Does matter - Solidifer at top, Subdivision after it - You want the extrusion to happen first, and THEN round that edge, 
** FOR MODIFIERS ** Blender Works top to bottom, ORDER DOES MATTER **
To make the icing less jagged we can change the 'Edge Data' option in the 'solidifier modifier' = Will tell blender before you do the solidify step, add a crease on the inner part
  Tut - change the 'Edge Data' option in the 'solidifier modifier' = Change the 'Crease Inner' to '1.0'
Next we are adding some 'Drip'(not zoomerspeak - literal) - Instead of stretching out the vertices, you need to give it more information by 'Extruding'
'Extrude' = Select Vertices while holding down 'Shift', After - Hold 'E' and Pull the Selection Downwards(or whatever direction) to Extrude it = It will add a new section/face, like a tail/trail to our icing

Part 4 = Sculpting ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================
'Shrink Wrap Modifier' = Add Modifier -> 'Deform' -> 'ShrinkWrap' = Needs to know 'Target' use 'EyeDropper' = Position Matters, Needs to be on top of 'Solidify' ->
  Will wrap an object to another object, will be subtle changes, points where the meshes weren't directly connected, it will connect them
  Tut -  After you have fixed the objects, just click 'Apply'(Ctrl + A) and it will Apply the changes and remove it from the 'Modifiers' stack
  Tut - First apply the Shrink Wrap Modifer -> Next Apply the Solidify Modifer
After we applied the 'Solidify Modifier' it took our 2D mesh and made it 3D so we can change the consistency of the icing glaze - Tedious to select points and draw them out by hand, 
'Sculpt Mode' = Top Left of Viewport DropDown = Tools will appear to the left hand side of viewport, each one allows us to do different things to the shape
  'I' = 'Inflate Brush' = Left hand side of sculpt mode = will allow us to 
  'F' = 'Change Brush Size' = Pull out to increase brush size, move mouse in to decrease, left click to confirm - you can set the brush tool to 'Front Faces Only' so it won't accidentaly go through the other side, 
    'Ctrl + I' = 'Invert Mask' = Will invert the mask on the object you painted, and switch it with the unpainted area
  'Shift + F' = 'Increase/Decrease Strength of Brush' = Shift out (Increase Stength) / Shift In (Decrease Strength), left click to confirm
  'G' = 'Grab brush' = allows you to push on objects, like pushing clay with your finger - can use to exagerate the design
  'M' = 'Mask Tool' = When you draw it will put down a gray layer that will cancel out any other tool you use on it (so if you inflate, the grayed out area won't be affect - kinda like JBoomers and actual inflateSean)
  'Mesh Filter' Sculpt Tool = 'Inflate' Click Drag to right/Left'Deflate = Applies a uniform value to the entire mesh, doesn't matter where you click on the mesh
  'Smooth Tool' = Hold 'Shift' in sculpt mode = Will smooth the selected area, the default values are high, should probably drop those on first use
Don't go low resolution for things that are round because, they will almost indefinitely appear as jagged edges
  Tut- 'Subdivision Modifier' - Increased 'Levels Viewport' to 2 and 'Apply' = 1(4x) * 2(4x) = 16x the details/vertices - that's alot of vertices - Phil Swift
  Tut - Now apply the 'Sculpt Mode' 'Inflate Brush' 
If you are applying a 'Subdivision Modifier', the 'Render' Levels will disapear - it will just use the 'Levels Viewport' for Viewport and Rendering
We can use the 'Mask Tool' To create an area that will only be affected by the inflation when we use the inflate tool (opposite inversean)
  Tut - 'Mask Tool' Set Opacity to 1.0, and go along the ridges of the top to simulate where the glaze would pool on an actual donut
To apply a uniform inflation to all parts unmasked 'Mesh Filter', apply some and smooth it out with 'Mask' -> 'Smooth Mask'

Part 5 = Shading ======================================================================================================================================================================================================================
'Material' Tab = Red Circle on far right hand side = Allows us to apply a material/texture/mesh to the currently selected object
  After Selecting *ENSURE THAT THE 'VIEWPORT SHADING(x4 circles)' In top right of Viewport is turned on*
  'Base Color' = An Option that will appear, that will allow you to change the color of the currently selected object
    'Dot' Next to 'Base Color' = Click -> Pop Down -> Image Texture -> Will replace the color with an image texture = Will need to add in an image -> Download an image to use as a texture
  'Roughness Value' = An Option = Reflection, the smaller this value, the more reflective/shiny your material will appear - the larger the 'rougher'/porous
  Tut - Roughness Value = 0.3 / Pink Material Added to Icing / Orangeish yellow added to donut
  Tut - add a marble countertop slab 'Shift + A' -> Mesh -> 'Plane' - 'S' = Scale Up / 'G' = Grab, move it up onto the counter
If you want objects to move together/attach to another object while still being it's own seperate object, you need to 'Parent' it - Objject you want to follow selected first, and object you want to 'Parent' selected last
  'Parent' = 'Ctrl + P' = First select the object you want to follow the other object(Child) -> 'Object (Keep Transform)' from menu that appears -> You can now move them both as a single object
'F3' = Search = Will search for anything you can try to do
Most texture you find from google image search are good for websites, not 3D, if you are using an image texture - Missing details like how it reflects lights/bumps on surface, shameless self plug - theres also an addon:
https://www.poliigon.com/
  Tut - Signed in with google, downloaded a free quartz - 160Mb for a texture - 8k resolution - 16 bit depth - Click on the one that ends with 'COL'
'Shading' Tab Top of screen dropdown = will change layout of screen x4 windows, the one with the files is superfluous = to remove, right click on the divider and select 'Join Areas' select the area you want to remove 
  Guy with 1000's of hours of blender experience says that he has never needed either of the ones on the left hand side, I should probably close them as well - that's prime real estate wasted, close both top and bottom left hand side
  'Node Setup' = Bottom section of 'Shading' = exact duplicate of what we did to initially set up the mesh on the right hand side, but as a flowchart
  'Nodes' = Work on a left to right basis, starts at: image texture -> shader -> material output - Between each node, you can add another node
    'Shift + A' = Add a node Dropdown menu (many options) = Add a red hue saturation to change the hue color to red on the marble (like light from a red stained glass window) 
Tut - We want to use the 'Roughness Map' we downloaded from the 'Image Texture - 160Mb' we just downloaded - 
  Tut - 'Shading' -> 'Node Setup' -> Drag out circle from 'Shader Tab -> Roughness Option Circle' -> Type 'Image Texture - Color' -> 'Open' -> File with 'Rougness' in the name
  Tut - After adding the 'Rougness Texture' we need to tell blender that this is a special map by changing the 'Color Space:' from 'SRGB' to 'Non-color'
  Tut - Now we need to add in 'Bumps' under the 'Normal' Value in 'Shader Node' - Drag the 'Normal Circle' out and 'Image Texture - Color' -> 'Open' -> 'NRM_8k_METALNESS' Open that one ... the purple one -> Change 'SRGB' to 'Non-color'
    Tut - Still not done, need to convert it into something that the image texture can read -> 'Shift + A' to add a new node -> 'Vector' -> 'Normal Map' -> Connect it between the 'Image Texture' and 'Shader'
Normal in 3D = What direction the Face is pointing - not what 'Normal' means to normies normally
'Normal Map' = A specialized map to pretend that there is detail on the normal face, like bumps and divets - What we just made was a 'PBR Shader' 
'Ctrl + Space' = Full Screen - will hide the 'Node Setup' screen - can zoom in and inspect the changes 
If you download the 'Poliigon Addon' from the tut guy, it will do all the above Node work for us next time, also downloads quicker, by just clicking 'Apply' in the addon - now we kNOW the process, for future reference
'/' = Isolate Mode - Will only look at the selected object - will also disable lighting/camera - Top Right to turn on 'Material Preview' (one of the 4 circles)
'Texture Paint' = Very Top Menu where you can find the shading tab = 
  'Create New Texture' = You are painting into an image, the image doesn't exist yet, so we have to give it one - 'Material Tab' -> 'Image Texture' -> 'New' 
  Tut - HSV = Hue = 0.086 / Saturation = 0.591 / Value = 1.0 / Alpha = 1.0 AND Hue = 0.091 / Saturation = 0.266 FOR THE PAINTING PART (LESS DARK) SECTION
  'Paint Texture' = Select the newly created texture from dropdown menu on the left hand side = start 'painting' the new mesh/material - you can paint either the square mesh on the left or directly to the object on the right
    The left hand side square is the unwrapped donut mesh 2D texture/flat image wrapped around a 3D object - UV Unwrapping 
'Image*' = If you see the '*' star it means that it hasn't been saved to your blender '.blend' file, you will need to manually save the Mesh/Image texture for future use

Part 6 = Geometry Nodes(sprinkles)======================================================================================================================================================================================================
Sprinkle Sprinkle vs Drizzle Drizzle Vs Grizzle Grizzle - We are going to sprinkle some sprinkles onto our donut, also known as 'Geometry Nodes'
'Geometry Nodes' = Top of screen same place where you can find shading and texture paint = Actually a modifier, when you create a new node, you create a new modifier =
  'Geometry Nodes' Allow you to do some crazy stuff like animaSeans that previously would of required some custom scripting before 
  Top left part of screen is called 'Spreadsheet', you don't need it - 'Right Click Divider' -> 'Join Areas' -> Click on the 'SpreadSheet' to remove it
Tut - Select 'Icing' -> Click 'New' in bottom middle half -> Will create 2 nodes - 'Group Input' = Mesh / 'Group Output' = Will take mesh and spit out whatever is in Grp Output
Tut - to add some sprinkles we want to scatter some points onto our mesh - 'Shift A'(add) -> 'Point' -> 'Distribute Points on Faces' -> Move to inbetween 'Input' and 'Output' (click and drag)
  The Icing has disapeared because we told blender to take the icing (input) and convert it into points(outputs) - we need to tell blender 'Yes, we want the points, but we also want the original mesh' we do that by:
  Tut - 'Shift A' -> 'Geometry' -> 'Join Geometry' - Note on the left side it's an '|' not an '.' connector - the elongated connector shows that it can take multiple inputs, not just one
    So what we can do is take the 'Group Input' Connector and feed it over to the 'Join Geometry' '|' connector -  Now we will have both the original Mesh and the new Points
If you add a 'Set Position' Node on the icing inbetween 'Input' and 'Output' and increase the 'Z-Axis' it will raise it on your screen, but in actuality, the mesh would not have moved off the donut - it just appears to have done so
  You can move the 'Offset' circle to the 'Input' (Click and drag) and it will allow you to change it on the fly from modifier sidebar on the fly - essentially creating your own tool to play with values
The points don't exist (in render) until we tell it what to render them as, we need to add an object to be our sprinkle - starting with a round ball
Tut - 'Shift + A'(In viewport) -> 'Mesh' -> 'UV Sphere' = Will be referenced for every single sprinkle So - Segments = 12 / Rings = 8 / Radius = 0.01m
Tut - To add the newly created sphere to our 'Nodes' go to the collection(top right) and drag the sphere to the 'Node Geometry section' - now we need another node to reference the new object
Tut - 'Shift + A' (in node) -> Instances -> Instance on Points = Add inbetween 'Distribution Points on Faces' and 'Join Geometry' -> Drag 'Geometry' from 'Sphere Object Info' to 'Interface' of 'Instance on Points'
  Now our spheres should appear all over the icing, if we increase the density = more spheres, they are crowding eachother and overlap, we need to change this 'Random' distribution to 'Poisson Disk' in the dropdown menu
    'Poisson Disk' = Change the 'Distance Min' to 0.014 m = Each sphere will now have a little radius around it
Click 'Pin' = If you click another object, you won't see nodes, it only shows nodes for the currently selected object, click the pin to change this
We are currently spawning these little balls everywhere on the icing -Top(good), bottom(not good), underneath in between the donut and icing, it will take resources to render this, to fix this, we need to:
'Weight Painting' = Top Left Mode Dropdown menu -> Select 'Weight Paint' -> Mesh will become blue = Will allow you to paint a value between 0 and 1 and then reference it however you want 
  'Ctrl + Click' While Weight Painting = Will do a -Negative Paint and remove some paint you've put down
  'Weight' = Will change the value your brush will paint / 'Radius' = radius of brush
  Default Blue Value = '0' / Red Value = '1' (In our version - Light Blue = '1')
  You use weight painting alot for rigging and animation to assign values to certain bones 
Currently our painting is having no effect, we first need to reference in our 'Geometry Nodes' (Check the 'Data' Tab mid right, It's called a 'Vertex Group'
Tut -In the 'Distribute Nodes on Faces' Node - You can reference the painted density mask 'Density Factor' Click the circle, drag and release, search 'Named Attribute' add it, and add your renamed vertex from vertex groups to the 'Name'
Sprinkle Sprinkle the donut - typically on the top with dabz randomly 
'NumPad .' Numpad Period Key = Quickly Zoom to a selected item in your collection
'`' Tilda Key = Will bring up a circle menu that will allow you to positon camera(Top/Front/Back/Left/Right/View Camera/View Selected)
Tut - With Sphere Collected in object mode - Right click anywhere in viewport - 'Shade Smooth' to make the sprinkles round
At this point, if you were to duplicate the donut - they will both share the same node group, linked (same properties - will look the same) - 'Expose' it, to fix it do below :
  'Expose' = Drag the 'Density Max' value circle from 'Distribution Points on Faces' to 'Group Input' empty slot - the value will now appear in your modifier stack - This will tell blender that 'this is it's own seperate thing'
    and treat it differently - and will be independant for each object that share the same 'Geometry Node' - Creating a customized node group viewable in your modifiers if you duplicate many donuts, change values individually
'N' Press while in 'Properties' = Will pull up the 'Dimensions' Menu, 
'A' = Select everything in the entire scene 
'S' to scale + hold 'Ctrl' = Will increase/decrease in increments 
'Ctrl + A' + Selected Objects - Select 'Scale'(Will Apply Scale Globally) = When you change the scale, it is only changed locally, not globally, doing this will apply the scale to all the selected objects instead of faking it
Technically it's all relative so value shouldn't matter, but it does when rendering with depth of field or comparing it to other objects or camera settings, so try to create a value that's true-ish for objects in blender
After applying 'Scale' Globally - our sprinkles disapeared - Density is in relation to the entire scene, 'Bugs on windshield' example, the larger the object, the more bugs, smaller=fewer, to fix this you need to:
  Tut - increase the  'Density' and 'Distance min'   
Also Note to deselect All when trying to change density, wasted an embarrasing amount of time trying to figure out where the modifer is.. select the icing again by itself
The replacement numbers are very large - scale is too large - You can do a math value inside of your 'Geometry Node' setup to multiply the value, by adding another node, 
Inside 'Geometry Node' 'Shift A' -> Utilities -> Math -> Math -> change to 'Multiply' and 'Value' = Will allow you to add multiplication of scale, so you don't have to use ludicrous values

Step 7 = Geometry Nodes(Long Sprinkles)=================================================================================================================================================================================================
!ERROR! - Camera is locked for some reason, can't zoom, scroll or pan - need to fix: 
  Fix: Typically, when you can't zoom in as far as you'd like, it's because you're in perspective view instead of orthographic view. You can toggle between the two by hitting the “5” key on the numeric keypad.
'Shift + Right Click' (on the viewport) = Will move 3D cursor, the circle where new objects you create will spawn in 
Long Sprinkles - Same method as above, first we need to model the sprinkles - We are going to model small/medium/large and bent sprinkles
  Tut - 'Shift + A' -> Mesh -> Cylinder: Vertices = 12 / Radius = 0.001m / Depth = 0.001m 
  Tut - 'N' -> View Tab -> 'Clip Start' -> 0.001m = Our object is still too small and is clipping out, to fix this we need to change the 'Clip Start' Value, the default value will always clip on super small objects, need2remember2fix
  Tut - 'S' + Hold 'Z' = Will allow us to scale it on the Z axis (elongate it)
'Bevel' = 'Ctrl + B'(In Edit Mode + Face Select Mode) Scroll Up/Down or (+/-) will remove/add another 45 degree level each time = 'Edit Mode' + Top Left 3 square far right 'Face Select Mode' 
  Tut - Select both top and bottom face, 'Ctrl + B' To create a Bevel = He did 3 scrolls down/- = rounded both edges
  Tut - Created Small - 'Shift + D' to create duplicates for Med/Large/Bent + 'X' to move along X-Axis - select
'Duplicate' = 'Shift + D' With Object Selected = create duplicates
Change Orbit Sensitivity = Preferences > Navigation > Orbit & Pan > Orbit Sensitivity = Was Wayyyyyy too sensitive after shrinking objects, one flick would rotate the objects off screen - frustraSean trying to do 180 deg flip
