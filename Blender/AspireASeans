Goals/SideQuests - Stuff I want to build for future use / assets / projects - Before I can build, I need bricks, Before I can make bricks, I need clay. :
'Borrow' the background from the M!ovie 'Everything Everywhere all at once' and use it for 2 frames of the gif that I'll show for proof of work for my donut
2D / 3D NPC Models 
  NPC Mesh -> Borg Cube
Sisyphus AnimASean
3D / Chibi(Low Poly) Giga Yes Chad
Japanese street / Shinjuku - Neon Signs / JumboTron / Crosswalk = Iconic 
Synthwave Object Highlights - Jinx edit A LA - Aesthetics - Dopest Custom on Hover AEffects - looks like a 2D overlay on top of 3D model :

Jin Roh - Iron Wolf - MG42 - Chibi - Men only want one thing and it's fcking disgusting - Robot Power Armor
2D BluePrints/Resources/3D Model - Side By Side - Just Duplicate each object as you are building and arrange on a background after - 2x metal frame, 6x screws, etc 
Modelling / Statues - In order for something to exist in the real world, it must first exist as an idea, hermetic principle of mentalism - all is mind - we making it out of the nousphere with this one 
3D model of Sneeds Feed and Seed - Formerly Chucks - Start here with 3D modelling a house - this is as simple as it gets - 4 walls - a sign - aporch - a railing - and 2 chairs 
Low Poly Trees / Figure out a way to do topography for at least a square mile that won't destroy my PC if I try to run it, includes ElevASean, Water Table would also be cool, but how would you get that easily?
  Can do a square mile to start, then add on from there, 3D Scan Topography already exists(Scale Vs Cost Vs Accuracy? Pick 2 Scenario), and can load only what I'm looking at/using... this is how games render, Learn from the best, 
Figure out a way to do accurate lighting from sun, could do some super cool architectual designs / Sun Clocks(clocks that tell time based on sun positioning) if I can get that figured out in blender = East -> West 
Comfy Cabin = Individual Logs + DoveTail Joints / Japanese WoodWorking Joints / Windows / Doors / Frames / Accurate Measurements - Average LogSize for Hardwood? 
Comfy Cabin / Floor Plan / Mapping out area in blender - FloorPlans on LibreCAD -  
  Could we somehow get a drone to accurately read topography and do a patrol route without a connection + Come back/recharge - would I be helping to build my own futuristic tech dystopia enslavement If I built something like this? 
  Step 1) Escape Canada - Step 2) Money - Step 3) Build Cool Sh!t - Give them Nothing - Nihil - They have already taken enough - No Mas - No More - If they want to be slaves, let them build their own cage - Enjoy your failed state.
  They already have robotic lawnmowers - maybe work functionally similar to that? how would a drone 'perceive' the ground? If it detects a change, take a picture, and send a notificASean when it returns - OpenCV for python -> Embedded?

Delorean / Kawasaki Ninja / 暴走族 = Bōsōzoku = 'running wild and driving recklessly tribe' + 改造車 = Kaizōsha = "modified vehicles" = Specialized Bikes With Seats = AEsthetic AF
'Paranoia Panopticon' - Replace Every Camera with a 3D Eye that follows the cursor, horrorcore - In Chyna that's like 15 CCTV per street, subtle terror
Texture By Material List/Element = Steel(unoxidized) = This Texture, Galvanized Square Steel/Aluminum = That Texture, Wood = Texture X, DryWall = Texture Y, Concrete = Texture Z, etc, etc  
Skull mask - ballistic mask - First design the mask - then the overlay - Go bag/Kit - design each item - 
Cyberdeck - 3D Print + Circuit board (advanced AF project - Future Sean problem -Step 1) - Or just get an old thinkpad and trick it out / Pelican Case cyberdeck 
XTreme Off Road Chicken Coop = She will eat zee bugz, She will live in zee podz, She will produce many eggz, and I vwill be happy
Festival Bestival Bus - Stripped and redesigned bus - "I live in a van down by the river" used to be a Chris Farley joke, now it's a lifegoal. - Thanks, JBoomers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2VIEY9-A8&ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive
  Transport of 'goods' /  Hydraulic/Sliding Opening back or sides -> converts into a Food Cart Side Hustle "Seans Sausages" - Already have the recipes, Materials + 500% markup = Profit of 100's-1000's a day = Fun(d) my trip / 
  modular with bed - galvanized square steel + 0m^2 - let me guess, you need more? Learn2Weld / Carry shop tents/material + Cooling/Generator on bus - half for work / half for sleep - 
  Step 1) Escape canada - 20 years to unfck the JBoomers damage, save money/build in another country - come back once they clean up '"their"' own mess - impossible to save money/live in canada = half taxes+half rent+ CoLiving - Escape. 
  Based and Buspilled: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL3Kw7rHErM&t=36s&ab_channel=MobileDwellings
  Could also refurb an old military 2.5 tonne - Offroad/Suspensean - To get very very very far down by the river, I'mma go inna woods M!'Into the Wild' - but with antibiotics and a happy ending, no vaxcattle to pester me, uncle Ted
  There's a reason why those trucks are sub 20k, doolies, you need a special license, forgot, CDL - JBoomers and their bureacracies/licenses - their entire lives is just one big appeal 2 government - half dependant on a failed state Lol,
