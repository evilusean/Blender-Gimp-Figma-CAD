Goals/SideQuests - Stuff I want to build for future use / assets / projects - Before I can build, I need bricks, Before I can make bricks, I need clay. :
'Borrow' the background from the M!ovie 'Everything Everywhere all at once' and use it for 2 frames of the gif that I'll show for proof of work for my donut can use a video as a texture - use FFMPG to cut from movie:

2D / 3D NPC Models 
  NPC Mesh -> Borg Cube
  Similar to this but with NPC's AnimASean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKPhjkw3Y84&ab_channel=cyriak&t=1m23s
Sisyphus AnimASean
3D / Chibi(Low Poly) Giga Yes Chad
Japanese street / Shinjuku - Neon Signs / JumboTron / Crosswalk = Iconic 
Synthwave Object Highlights - Jinx edit A LA - Aesthetics - Dopest Custom on Hover AEffects - looks like a 2D overlay on top of 3D model :

Jin Roh - Iron Wolf - MG42 - Chibi - Men only want one thing and it's fcking disgusting - Robot Power Armor
2D BluePrints/Resources/3D Model - Side By Side - Just Duplicate each object as you are building and arrange on a background after - 2x metal frame, 6x screws, etc

Modelling / Statues - In order for something to exist in the real world, it must first exist as an idea, hermetic principle of mentalism - all is mind - we making it out of the nousphere with this one 
3D model of Sneeds Feed and Seed - Formerly Chucks - Start here with 3D modelling a house - this is as simple as it gets - 4 walls - a sign - aporch - a railing - and 2 chairs 
Low Poly Trees / Figure out a way to do topography for at least a square mile that won't destroy my PC if I try to run it, includes ElevASean, Water Table would also be cool, but how would you get that easily?
  Can do a square mile to start, then add on from there, 3D Scan Topography already exists(Scale Vs Cost Vs Accuracy? Pick 2 Scenario), and can load only what I'm looking at/using... this is how games render, Learn from the best, 
Figure out a way to do accurate lighting from sun, could do some super cool architectual designs / Sun Clocks(clocks that tell time based on sun positioning) if I can get that figured out in blender = East -> West

Delorean / Kawasaki Ninja / 暴走族 = Bōsōzoku = 'running wild and driving recklessly tribe' + 改造車 = Kaizōsha = "modified vehicles" = Specialized Bikes With Seats = AEsthetic AF
'Paranoia Panopticon' - Replace Every Camera with a 3D Eye that follows the cursor, horrorcore - In Chyna that's like 15 CCTV per street, subtle terror
Texture By Material List/Element = Steel(unoxidized) = This Texture, Galvanized Square Steel/Aluminum = That Texture, Wood = Texture X, DryWall = Texture Y, Concrete = Texture Z, etc, etc  
MSG Las Vegas 3D Sphere Building - 16K LED - use a gif/movie as a mesh - super easy geometry - sphere on a square

Skull mask - ballistic mask - First design the mask - then the overlay - Go bag/Kit - design each item - 
Cyberdeck - 3D Print + Circuit board (advanced AF project - Future Sean problem -Step 1) - Or just get an old thinkpad and trick it out / Pelican Case cyberdeck - LORA Mesh Network in a box -  
Laughter Bots - Design a small basic drone swarm that can be used for a short period to create funny designs to make people laugh, accessories like lights can also be attached, controlled by a central hub
  Most parts can be 3D printed, or mass produced plastics(cheap) - except the electronics, which has gotten cheap, might not even need a gyro if the software is good enough, could probably run an ESP32/Arduino or custom chip(cheap)
  Build 3D printable blueprints for this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa6EslOHsI0&t=26s&ab_channel=MaxImagination
  IR Tracking for Swarm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ql20JKrscQ&ab_channel=JoshuaBird
Design a long range surveilance drone that can run on a 2 stroke gasoline lawnmower engine, essentially a camera in a tube that is able to transmit encrypted pictures - could be done for less than the cost of a car
  Similar to this but with gasoline engine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn87IyFPEy4&ab_channel=AeroStuffFPV

Comfy Cabin = Individual Logs + DoveTail Joints / Japanese WoodWorking Joints / Windows / Doors / Frames / Accurate Measurements - Average LogSize for Hardwood? 
Comfy Cabin / Floor Plan / Mapping out area in blender - FloorPlans on LibreCAD -  
  Could we somehow get a drone to accurately read topography and do a patrol route without a connection + Come back/recharge - would I be helping to build my own futuristic tech dystopia enslavement If I built something like this? 
  Step 1) Escape Canada - Step 2) Money - Step 3) Build Cool Sh!t - Give them Nothing - Nihil - They have already taken enough - No Mas - No More - If they want to be slaves, let them build their own cage - Enjoy your failed state.
  They already have robotic lawnmowers - maybe work functionally similar to that? how would a drone 'perceive' the ground? If it detects a change, take a picture, and send a notificASean when it returns - OpenCV for python -> Embedded?
XTreme Off Road Chicken Coop = She will eat zee bugz, She will live in zee podz, She will produce many eggz, and I vwill be happy
Festival Bestival Bus - Stripped and redesigned bus - "I live in a van down by the river" used to be a Chris Farley joke, now it's a lifegoal. - Thanks, JBoomers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2VIEY9-A8&ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive
  Transport of 'goods' /  Hydraulic/Sliding Opening back or sides -> converts into a Food Cart Side Hustle "Seans Sausages" - Already have the recipes, Materials + 500% markup = Profit of 100's-1000's a day = Fun(d) my trip / 
  modular with bed - galvanized square steel + 0m^2 - let me guess, you need more? Learn2Weld / Carry shop tents/material + Cooling/Generator on bus - half for work / half for sleep -

  Could also refurb an old military 2.5 tonne - Offroad/Suspensean - To get very very very far down by the river, I'mma go inna woods M!'Into the Wild' - but with antibiotics and a happy ending, no vaxcattle to pester me, uncle Ted
  Bus requires a special license 'drivers require a Class B, C, E or F driver's licence in Ontario' make sure you pay your taxes or else who will tell you what you can and can't do, what you should or shouldn't be ing(j)es(c)ting  
  Might just have to get a large van - before touring the americas - There's a reason why those trucks are sub 20k, doolies, you need a special license, forgot, CDL 
  There's an entire subculture online about this called 'VanLife' and it's just a massive millenial copefest for being shafted by JBoomers - You didn't choose the vanlife, the vanlife chose you. (Thanks, JBoomers.)
