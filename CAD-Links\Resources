CAD Programs:

Blender is great for 3d printing, especially when you like to do more artistic stuff. I also use it for "CAD", but there are some limitations due to it's non-standard modeling approach 
(which on the other hand can be a joy to work with and is very mesh-based; which is a good thing for 3d-printing). Huge, expanding projects can become a mess over time and CAD-like precision sometimes is a bit quirky to maintain.

If you're looking for functional prints, there are softwares much better for it since they work as CAD, and thus understand the constraints of a physical object, which blender does not natively. 
I personally use Fusion360 (free, too) a lot more for 3d printing

I use Blender, export from that to .stl, then import the .stl into Prusaslicer.
It works well, but there are two problems I've noticed.
One. Export will get EVERYTHING. Including geometry you've hidden. This makes booleans an issue as things you've modeled to cut OUT of the model are still there. So you have to apply the booleans,
then erase everything you don't want before you export.
Two. Blender is ill-suited to CAD-type applications. You CAN turn on edge lengths and corner angles, but it's a mess. I still use it, for CAD-type applications, because I was already exposed to Blender
before I got into 3D printing.

Running on Linux does limit you some, but you still have a number of options open. Blender is a good polygon modeler, but as others have stated, a poly modeler and a parametric CAD app are two different things. 
Not that people haven't made really great looking things in poly apps, but the goal of a poly app is to make something that "looks" right, as opposed to having it be dimensionally accurate.

For native (installable) parametric CAD apps, you have:

FreeeCAD - this one you know about. Very capable, but can be a little picky and unforgiving at first. Prepare to rage quit at least once or twice.

LibreCAD - Free, works on linux

SolveSpace - it's a nice program for what it does, but it is kind of limited (no fillets/chamfers or lofting, for example) so, if you run into the limitations, you end up needing to jump to another app anyway.

BricsCAD Shape - seems capable, but feels geared toward architectural design (things like default scale of projects, etc.)

If you have a persistent internet connection and don't mind using web apps (web browser based / cloud storage) you have:

TinkerCAD - very simplistic, geared toward kids, but can be useful.

SketchUp Personal - again, you can probably get something usable out of it, as I've downloaded parts that were designed in it, but it's geared toward architectural design and only for non-commercial use.

OnShape - very capable free tier of a pro application, but the free version can only be used non-commercially, and all your designs are viewable/forkable by any other user of the application.

Being from a software background, you may also be interested in the programmatic CAD apps like OpenSCAD or CadQuery - these work by defining your models in a declarative language and viewing the results. 
Not something most people are after, but may fit your use case.

Architects Software:================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Basic Software :
Floor Plan Software (for linux) :
SweetHome 3D / AutoCAD / SketchUp
https://www.tech-edv.co.at/05_LUnIx/80_CAD~2f3d/10_CAD~20Links/index.php
AutoCAD: industry-standard 2D drafting software in most parts of the world. Many are (or trying to) replace this with BIM software, but this is not happening anytime soon in many places, especially in the developing world.
SketchUp: industry-standard simple 3D modeller. Easy to pickup, intuitive in a childish sort of way. Very extensible, excellent compatibility with the renderers and bigger modellers. Warehouse is very useful.
  Has some issues with curved geometry, but nothing too restrictive, and definitely here to stay.
Photoshop: You know this one. While best used along with Illustrator and Indesign, many get by with Ps alone.
3D:
Rhinoceros: Sort of a SketchUp alternative, but much more powerful out-of-the-box. Excellent support for curved geometry. More logically built than SU, I'd say.
  Very popular among some groups, but not as popular as SketchUp. Grasshopper, the parametric design plugin, is a major feature of Rhino.
3DS Max / Maya / Blender / Cinema 4D / Zbrush: These are advanced 3D software which are industry-standard in other industry such as Vfx and Gaming. 
  They are used for high quality archviz, and you probably won't need them unless archiviz is really important to you or you want keep options open for these other industries.
BIM:
The future. Or not, depending on where you live. But certainly a very desirable skill, since using it tends to be more complicated than say AutoCAD. There are two key players here: 
  Revit and ArchiCAD. Revit is from Autodesk, the giant behind AutoCAD, and is industry-standard in the US and Asia, but does not support macOS. ArchiCAD is ofted considered more architect friendly, 
  but most of its market is in Europe. There's also VectorWorks, but if you haven't already heard of it, it's probably not for you.
Renderers:
Vray, Maxwell, Corona, Cycles, etc.: Raytracing renders. Can produce stunning photorealistic renders, but take more preparation as well as rendering time, along with considerable expertise. Most of the work with most 3D software
Enscape, Lumion, Twinmotion, Evee, etc.: Real-time renderers, a fairly recent development. Render quickly, are easier to set up, and many are moving to these from traditional renderers. 
  These also usually offer better support for videos and AR/VR.
Topography:
This is the workflow I use mostly,

However I have also used this for Hawaii

And finally this is equally good.
